The Earth Engine API is a large collection of objects and methods that allow you to perform a wide range of operations â€” from simple mathematical calculations to complex image processing algorithms.
In the Code Editor, you can click on the Docs tab to see a list of the API functions, organized by object type. All API functions have the prefix ee (short for Earth Engine)

However, in Earth Engine, you should not add numbers directly using JavaScript operators like a + b.
Instead, you must use Earth Engine's built-in API functions.
This is important to ensure your code runs efficiently and avoids errors like timeouts.
To add a and b:
Convert a into an Earth Engine object using ee.Number(a).
Then, use the .add(b) method to add b to a.

Why Use API Functions?
Because Earth Engine uses a cloud computing system.
If you perform operations directly in JavaScript (like a + b), the results might be incorrect or the execution could fail.
Always use API functions to ensure that your operations are properly executed on the Earth Engine server.
Another Example: Creating a List of Years
Suppose you want to create a list of years from 1980 to 2020, with a 5-year interval.
