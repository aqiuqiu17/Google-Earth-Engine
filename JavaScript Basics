1. Variables
   In programming, a variable is like a container that stores information of data. In JavaScript,
   we create a variable using the keyword var, followd by name we want to give the variable
   Example:
                                  var province = 'Jawa Barat';
   This means that we are creating a container called city, and we are storing to the text 'bandung' inside that container.

   A few importtant notes:
      - when we are storing text (string), we must surround it with quotation marks, we can use single (') or double (")
      - normaly, each command (or line of code) ends wiwth a semicolon (;)
      - when we print the variable, the value stored inside it will appear in the console.
      - wgen we assign a text value to a variable, the variable is automatically given the type string.
      - when we assign a number, the variables becomes a type called number.
2.  Lists
    sometimes, we need to store multiple value inside a single variable.
    To do This, JavaScript provides a data structure call a list ( also known as an array). A list can hold many values together in one place
    To create a list we use square brackets [] and we add multiple values inside, separated by commas (,)
                                var provinces = ['Jawa Barat', 'Jawa Tengah', Jawa Timur']
    when we print this code, at earth engine we will see the word list appear in the console, along with a small arrows (>) next to ir.
    and we must know that each item in the list has its own index number, when the index starts at 0 not 1
3.  Objects
    while lists allow us to store multiple values inside one variable, they are not ideal when we want to so to store structured data 
    to creatte an object:
      - curly braces {}.
      - write each-ky value pair inside the brace, with the format 'key': value
      - separate each pair with a comma,
4.  Function
    A function is a structured block of code designed to recive input (called parameters), perform a series of operations based on that input, and return the outpit
    define a function:
      - use the keyword function
      - spsify the function name and parameter(s) inside parentheses ()
      - write the operations inside curly braces {}
      - use the return keyword to specify what value the function should output
5.  Comments
    comments in programming are lines of text written within the code to explain, give notes, or remind about what a specific part of the program does
    to create comments in java script:
      - use two forward shlashes // at the beginning of a line
      - Anything after // on that line becomes a comment
